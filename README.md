Using this Project you can create a Data in CSV and Generate Report and Visulize the data . ( NOTE : Download the Data Entry folder , ICONS folder  and Insurance Firm.py on Destop , Otherwise it won't Work ) 

I have used Libraries like Pandas , Numpy , Cutomtkinter , Reportlab and much more . 

Download the all the files on Destop otherwise it won't Work .
